# Diabetes Supplies Project

This project was in the back of my mind for a long time. It was previously developed in C, but did not have a GUI or database.
It was very rudimental. I wanted to take a step ahead and improve it (as well as my knowledge with Java, JavaFX, and MySQL). It is a very dear project to me, as I've been diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes since February 2004. I love to apply the skills that I possess to solve real life problems.

This project was incentivated by Professor Vanselow, and his COP 3003 class. 
The files contained in this repository are used for grading purposes in the COP 3003 class of the fall semester 2018.

The languages used are **Java**, **JavaFX**, and **SQL**.
This project is going to be under constant development. Whenever something will need to be added to the program, it will also  be displayed under the **TODO** section of this README.
